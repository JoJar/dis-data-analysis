# dis-data-analysis
These are the files for my ongoing [03.08.21] dissertation project.
No data has been shared with the repo, both due to the unknown ethical
repercussions (as the current data was collected by an internal organisation
with seperate ethical approval) and the 100mb limit GitHub enforces.

My current focus within this project is in the use of pronouns between English
and Russian tweets percieved to contain 'misinformation callouts' by the
sentinel system. (Preece et al. 2018)

Over the next couple of weeks I will also be using BeautifulSoup on URLs scraped
from the datasets alongside nlp techniques to gain an idea of the types of websites
being shared within these tweets, and make a comparison between the Ru and En data.
